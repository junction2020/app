## Our idea
We offer an interactive, informative digital sticker collection world to end-consumers of responsible meat products by HKScan brands. The digital sticker collection world allows end-consumers to collect their stickers upon purchasing a meat product by scanning a unique QR code that is placed inside the product package. Each QR code will be transformed automatically into a brand sticker in the collection world upon scanning. 

Once consumers scan their unique QR code, the collection world will be loaded for the consumer and an overview of the sticker collection can be explored. Each sticker contains the brand logo that represents the product that was scanned and links to a comparison of aggregated data of the estimated water footprint, the carbon footprint, the average space per animal, and the average lifespan of an animal species upon clicking. 

The data for our visualizations was partly based on averaged calculations from the water footprint data provided by HKScan as well as global average water footprints for meat production published in scientific research papers for comparison purposes.  

Next to the exploration of the personal sticker collection, the consumer can click on the 'Goals' tab of the website menu to get an overview of all available sustainable project categories that various HKScan selected farms are working on at the moment. Once all stickers are collected by the consumer, hence 15 products have been purchased, the consumer can select a sustainable project category of their choice such as the development of a windmill, a solar panel collection, or a renovation of the animal stables. 

The objective of the sticker collection is thus to enable consumers to support sustainable farming and at the same time engage with the HKScan brand. Consumers can support their preferred projects without choosing one particular farm, but a variety of farms that currently have a project in this category (e.g. making more space for their chickens). 

To give consumers more incentives to complete the sticker collection if needed, a product discount can be introduced that can be redeemed upon completion of 15 stickers in the collection world. The donation for sustainable projects would be contributed by HKScan's customers such as retailing brands in the meat industry. By giving a specified amount of donations per completed sticker book towards the project, brands can increase the engagement with their consumers and at the same time work on their brand awareness and reputation by committing their efforts towards sustainable farming. 

To build the web-app, we used React and Tailwind CSS.
